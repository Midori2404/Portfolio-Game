  description: This is a 2D drag-and-drop mobile game developed with my team for
    the Etiqa+ Minigame Project competition. The game was designed to promote insurance
    awareness through interactive gameplay, blending fun mechanics with educational
    themes. Our group achieved 2nd Runner-Up in the competition, and I contributed
    to both programming and game design aspects, focusing on user interaction and
    gameplay flow.
