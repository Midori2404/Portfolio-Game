  description: This is a multiplayer top-down roguelike game created with my group
    during the third year of my degree. Built in Unity using Photon PUN for connectivity.
    The project allowed players to connect and cooperate in procedurally generated
    levels. My main responsibilities included implementing multiplayer functionality,
    gameplay logic, and level building while ensuring synchronization and stability
    across networked sessions.
