  description: "Veilborn Woods is a 3D forest exploration game developed as my final-year

    Challenges,\u201D the project focuses on improving players\u2019 problem-solving
    abilities through exploration and puzzle-based gameplay. I was primarily responsible

    and scene transitions, while collaborating with teammates on design and environment
    creation to deliver an immersive experience."
